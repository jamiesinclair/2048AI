# 2048AI

I'm building the 2048 game so I can experiment with different approaches to solving it algorithmically.


To do:


- (4/17/14) randomly place a square in an open space
- (4/17/14) swipe squares across the board
- (4/17/14) merge function that joins two squares of the same value when bumped by a swipe


- Create basic "bot" that will play the game
- experiment with simple techniques (e.g. alternate up and left)
- Implement heuristics to more intelligently play the game (e.g. look ahead, keeping high values in corner)
